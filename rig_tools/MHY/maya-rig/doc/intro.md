# Introduction

The MHY package *maya-rig* contains MHY's core Maya rigging API, as well as actions
for procedural rigging (powered by [Protostar](https://git.woa.com/MHY/protostar)).
Actions include rig limbs, data import actions, and other rig utility actions.

This documentation mainly covers:

+ How to proceduralize rig build using the built-in actions.
+ How to develop custom rig limbs.

We also included a full API documentations for technical details.
